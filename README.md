# Student-Budget-Tracker
The Student Budget Tracker is a simple Python program that helps students manage their allowance and expenses effectively. It features input validation to prevent invalid or negative entries and ensures that expenses do not exceed the current balance.

**Features:**
- Add allowance with source description
- Add expense with automatic balance check
- View complete transaction history
- Display current balance in real-time
- Input validation for positive amounts only

**How It Works:**
Users can add their allowance or expenses, and the program automatically updates their balance and records each transaction. All actions are done through a simple text-based menu for easy navigation.
